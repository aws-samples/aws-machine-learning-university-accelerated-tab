## Machine Learning University: Accelerated Tabular Data Class
This repository contains __slides__, __notebooks__, and __datasets__ for the __Machine Learning University (MLU) Accelerated Tabular Data__ class. Our mission is to make Machine Learning accessible to everyone. We have courses available across many topics of machine learning and believe knowledge of ML can be a key enabler for success. This class is designed to help you get started with tabular data (spreadsheet-like tables), learn about widely used Machine Learning techniques for tabular data, and apply them to real-world problems.

**Final Project:** Practice working with a "real-world" tabular dataset for the final project. Final project dataset is in the [data/final_project folder](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-machine-learning-university-accelerated-tab/tree/master/data/final_project). For more details on the final project, check out [this notebook](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-machine-learning-university-accelerated-tab/blob/master/notebooks/MLA-TAB-DAY1-FINAL.ipynb).
