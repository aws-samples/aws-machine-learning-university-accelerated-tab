    "[AutoGluon](https://autogluon.mxnet.io/tutorials/tabular_prediction/index.html) implements many of the best practices that we have discussed in this class, and more!  In particular, it sets itself apart from other AutoML solutions by having excellent automated feature engineering that can handle text data and missing values without any hand-coded solutions (See their [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.06505) for details).  It is too new to be in an existing Sagemaker kernel, so let's install it.\n",
